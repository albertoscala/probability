# Combination Math

## The principle foundamental of combination math

Let two experiments be performed. Suppose that the first experiment has $m$ possible outcomes, that for each of these the second experiment has $n$ possible outcomes. Then, if distinct sequences of outcomes of the two experiments produce distinct final outcomes, the two experiments have $mn$ possible outcomes in all.

### Example

A small community consists of 10 women, each of whom has three children. You want to elect one of these mothers and her child as mother and child of the year; how many choices are there?

**Solution**

One can see the mother's choice as the outcome of the first experiment and the subsequent choice of one of her children as the outcome of the second experiment; by the fundamental principle there are $10 * 3 = 30$ possible choices.
