# Combination Math

## The principle foundamental of combination math

Let two experiments be performed. Suppose that the first experiment has $m$ possible outcomes, that for each of these the second experiment has $n$ possible outcomes. Then, if distinct sequences of outcomes of the two experiments produce distinct final outcomes, the two experiments have $mn$ possible outcomes in all.
