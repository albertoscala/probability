## Conditional Probability

Let's suppose we have 2 dice and all the 36 possible outcomes are equally likely. We know that the first dice is a 3. What's the possibility that the sum of the two dice is 8?

The probability of getting a 3 on the first dice is $\frac{1}{6}$.
Then the possible outcomes that give us a sum of 8 are:

$$\lbrace(3,5),(3,6)\rbrace$$
