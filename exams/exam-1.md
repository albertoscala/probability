## Exercise 1

An urn contains 12 balls, 3 blue balls and 9 red balls. Anton draws 2 balls from the urn without replacement. If the two balls are both blue he launches three dice, otherwise he launches two dice.
Define the following events:

- $B_1 = \lbrace \text{two blue balls are drawn} \rbrace$
- $B_2 = \lbrace \text{two blue balls are not drawn} \rbrace$
- $C = \lbrace \text{the sum of the two dice is equal to two} \rbrace$
- $D_1 = \lbrace \text{the first ball drawn is blue} \rbrace$
- $D_2 = \lbrace \text{the second ball drawn is blue} \rbrace$

1. Put in relation the event $B_1$ adn the couple of events $D_1$ and $D_2$.
2. Determine $\mathbb{P}(B_1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B_2)$.
3. Determine $\mathbb{P}(C|B_1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(C|B_2)$.
4. Determine $\mathbb{P}(C)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B_1|C)$.
5. Be X the number of dice launched. Determine the set of values that the random variable X can assume, it's discrete density function and the expected value of X, $\mathbb{E}(X)$, and the expected value of $X^2$, $\mathbb{E}(X^2)$.
