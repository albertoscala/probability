# Exam 3

## Exercise 1

An urn contains 6 balls, 2 blue, 2 red and 2 green. Anton draws 2 balls with reinserting. If none of the balls drawn is blue then Anton will toss 2 times a fair coin, else he will toss two times a coin with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ of heads and probability $\frac{1}{3}$ of tails. In both cases the tosses are independent. Let define for $i \in \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace$ the following events:

- $B_i = \lbrace \text{the i-th ball drawn is blue} \rbrace$,
- $G_i = \lbrace \text{the i-th ball drawn is green} \rbrace$,
- $R_i = \lbrace \text{the i-th ball drawn is red} \rbrace$,
- $D = \lbrace \text{none of the balls drawn is blue} \rbrace$,
- $C_1 = \lbrace \text{the first coin tossed shows head} \rbrace$,

1. Check which of the following relations are true:
   1. $D = B^{c}_1 \cup B^{c}_2$,
   2. $D = B^{c}_1 \cap B^{c}_2$,
   3. $D = (V_1 \cup V_2) \cup (R_1 \cup R_2)$,
   4. $D = (V_1 \cap V_2) \cap (R_1 \cap R_2)$,
   5. $D = (V_1 \cup R_1) \cap (V_2 \cup R_2)$.
2. Determine $\mathbb{P}(D)$ and $\mathbb{P}(D^c)$,
3. Determine $\mathbb{P}(C_i|D)$ and $\mathbb{P}(C_i|D^c)$ for each $i \in \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace$,
4. Determine $\mathbb{P}(C_i)$ for each $i \in \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace$,
5. Check if the events $C_1$ and $C_2$ are independent presenting the necessary calculations,
6. Let $X$ be a random variable that assume the value 1 if at elast one of the balls drawn is blue and -1 otherwise. Determine the expectancy $\mathbb{E}(X)$ and the variance $Var(3X)$.

## Exercise 2

In a shop there are 100 boxes of light bulbs for sale, each box contains 10 bulbs, in which 3 are defective and 7 are not. Indipedently for each box the shopkeeper chooses 3 random bulbs: the 3 bulbs selected are
