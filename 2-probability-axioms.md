## Sample space 

The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space and is denoted by $S$ or $\Omega$.

#### Examples

If the outcome of an experiment is to determine the sex of an infant, then:

$$S = {m, f}$$

where the outcome f will indicate that the infant is female and m that it is male.

---

If the experiment consists of successively tossing two coins, then the sample space is formed by the following four points:

$$S = {(T,T),(T,C),(C,T),(C,C)}$$

The outcome will be $(T,T)$ if both coins gave heads, $(T,C)$ if the first coin gave heads and the second tails, $(C,T)$ if the first coin gave tails and the second heads and $(C,C)$ if both gave tails.

---

If the experiment consists of throwing two dice, then the sample space consists of 36 elements

$$S = {(i,j):i,j = 1,2,3,4,5,6}$$

dove l’esito $(i,j)$ indica che il numero $i$ compare nel dado più a sinistra e $j$ nell’altro dado.

## Events

Each subset $E$ of the sample space is called an event. In other words an event is a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment.

#### Examples

On the first example, the event $E = {f}$ is the event that the infant is a girl.

---

On the second example, the event $E = {(T,T),(T,C)}$ is the event that the first coin gave heads.

---

On the third example, the event $E = {(i,j):i+j = 7}$ is the event that the sum of the numbers on the two dice is 7.
